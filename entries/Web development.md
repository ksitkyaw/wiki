== Rewrite of Web Development and Web Design articles ==
The current articles for [[Web development]] and [[Web design]] have been listed in [[:Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_rewrite]]. To facilitate this process, I am creating [[Wikipedia:Subpages|subpages]] of the Talk pages for the each article, named [[Talk:Web development/Web development (rewrite)|Web development (rewrite)]] and [[Talk:Web design/Web design (rewrite)|Web design (rewrite)]]. Initially, these two pages will be stubs only, while I take stock of the existing material offline. I hope to post some progress before the end of 2006.

My plan is to improve the content in four stages:
# Provide a high-level taxonomy of the subject area;
# Reorganize the existing content according to that structure;
# Edit and improve the existing material where appropriate;
# Add missing material where it's needed.
That is the plan; in its execution, there will be some overlap within steps 2-4. And we can actually decide to replace the existing pages at any time after stage #2 is complete.
