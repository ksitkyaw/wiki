# Wikipedia like Web application

This application let any user create new entry pages using markdown, search for the entry pages, edit the content of individual entry pages, or go to a random entry page.

The project idea is inspired from [Project 1 of CS50 web programming course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/1/wiki/)
